        <dt>HTML/CSS</dt>
        <dd>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are fundamental technologies for creating the structure and visual design of web pages.</dd>
      
        <dt>JavaScript</dt>
        <dd>JavaScript is a versatile scripting language used for adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to web applications, making them responsive to user actions.</dd>
      
        <dt>Front-End Frameworks (e.g., React, Angular, Vue)</dt>
        <dd>Front-end frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue provide tools and components for building user interfaces and managing application state.</dd>
      
        <dt>Back-End Languages (e.g., Node.js, Python, Ruby, Java)</dt>
        <dd>Back-end languages like Node.js, Python, Ruby, and Java are used to develop the server-side logic of web applications, handle database operations, and serve data to the front end.</dd>
      
        <dt>Web Servers (e.g., Apache, Nginx)</dt>
        <dd>Web servers like Apache and Nginx are responsible for serving web content to users, handling requests, and managing server resources.</dd>
      
        <dt>Databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB)</dt>
        <dd>Databases store and manage the structured data used by web applications, and they come in various types, such as relational (e.g., MySQL), document-based (e.g., MongoDB), and more.</dd>
      
        <dt>APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)</dt>
        <dd>APIs allow different software components to communicate and exchange data, making it possible for web applications to interact with external services and resources.</dd>
      
        <dt>Version Control (e.g., Git)</dt>
        <dd>Version control systems like Git are essential for tracking changes in code, collaborating with others, and ensuring codebase integrity.</dd>
      
        <dt>Package Managers (e.g., npm, Yarn)</dt>
        <dd>Package managers are used to install, manage, and share libraries and dependencies necessary for web development projects.</dd>
      
        <dt>DevOps Tools (e.g., Docker, Jenkins)</dt>
        <dd>DevOps tools like Docker and Jenkins automate development, testing, and deployment processes, improving the efficiency and reliability of web development workflows.</dd>
